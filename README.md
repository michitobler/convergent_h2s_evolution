# Data and code for Greenway et al. (2020)
This repository includes data and code associated with Greenway et al.: "Convergent evolution of conserved mitochondrial pathways underlies repeated adaptation to extreme environments". A pre-print of this paper can be found on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.959916v2).

## Biochemical and physiologial analyses
Four datasets were associated with biochemical and physiological analyses:
- [Measurements of COX activity](https://github.com/michitobler/convergent_h2s_evolution/blob/master/physiology/cox_data_final.csv)
- [Measurements of SQR activity](https://github.com/michitobler/convergent_h2s_evolution/blob/master/physiology//SQRactivity.csv)
- [Measurements of mitochondrial H2S concentrations](https://github.com/michitobler/convergent_h2s_evolution/blob/master/physiology/mitoA_data.csv)
- [Measurements of mitochondrial respiration](https://github.com/michitobler/convergent_h2s_evolution/blob/master/physiology/mitochondrialrespiration.csv)

All data were analyzed and visualized in R. Executable code is available as an [R Markdown File](https://github.com/michitobler/convergent_h2s_evolution/blob/master/physiology/greenway_etal_analyses2.Rmd). Alternatively analyses and outputs can be [previewed as HTML](https://rawcdn.githack.com/michitobler/convergent_h2s_evolution/e804d3029742b6ae325ca7838299a546378b5220/physiology/greenway_etal_analyses2.html). 

## Comparative genomic analyses of *Poecilia mexiana*
- [Scripts for local ancestry analysis and the calculation of FST](https://github.com/michitobler/convergent_h2s_evolution/blob/master/fst_saguaro.md)

## Comparative transcriptomic analyses of Poeciliidae
- Comparative transcriptomics included analysis of gene expression variation and analysis of molecular evolution. Scripts for the entire analytical pipeline--from mappint to analysis in EVE and PAML--can be found [here](https://github.com/michitobler/convergent_h2s_evolution/blob/master/transcriptomics/mapping_to_EVE.txt)
- Two auxiliary python scripts associated with comparative transcriptomic analysis can be found in the ["transcriptomics" folder](https://github.com/michitobler/convergent_h2s_evolution/tree/master/transcriptomics).
